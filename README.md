# PROJECT: STUDY GDSCRIPT

This is the official repo for for learning the basics of GDScript (and by extension Python).

In this project, I will try to familiarize myself with:

1. The theory:
    - The syntax
    - The grammar
    - The paragraph structure

2. The practice:
    - Simple implementation of side-scrolling & isometric movements
    - Attaching scripts to specific events
    - Open/close file successfully
    - Extracting raw JSON as text
